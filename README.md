# SSAMBA: Self-Supervised Audio Mamba

## Introduction
This repository contains the official implementation (in PyTorch) of the the paper SSAMBA: Self-Supervised Audio Representation Learning with Mamba State Space Model. SSAMBA is an advanced audio representation learning model designed to leverage self-supervised learning techniques using the Mamba State Space Model. This project builds on the success of the Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST) and introduces novel methodologies to further enhance performance and efficiency on various audio tasks. 

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following commands:
